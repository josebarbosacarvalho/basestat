# baseStat (beta)
This project aims to publish analytis based on data openly available in the Open Contracting Data Standard (OCDS) format. 

The first example is being build based on the data published by the Portuguese Government in the following file: https://dados.gov.pt/en/datasets/ocds-portal-base-www-base-gov-pt/ 

Citizens can see the same information in the Base Portal: http://www.base.gov.pt/
